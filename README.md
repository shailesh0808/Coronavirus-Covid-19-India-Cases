# Coronavirus-Covid-19-India-Cases
 In this project we have to find out the covid-19 cases in india with perticular states. Also we have to consider the district data so we can take the necessary actions against situation and control the covid-19. So lets get started...

## Dataset
   Dataset has been downloaded from Kaggle.

   covid-19-india-data
   This repository contains data and code for scrapping and cleaning data on covid-19 in India 
   from https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ website and API provided by https://www.covid19india.org/
   
   MoHFW data :india:
    https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ is the official website of Ministry of Health and 
    Family Welfare (MoHFH) Government of India.
    MoFHW updates state level confirmed, death and recovered data.
## Technical Aspect
    This project is divided into two parts :-

    1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    2. Data Visualization

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  is done in the jupyter NoteBook in which we use four python libraries 
    1. Pandas
    2. Numpy 
    3. Matplotlib
    4. Seaborn
  
  **JupyterLab** is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks,
     code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, 
     scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand 
     and enrich functionality.
  
  The **Jupyter Notebook** is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. 
  It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience

### Data Visualization
     Data Visualization is done with the help of Power BI tool.

**Power BI** is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your 
     unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, 
     or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, 
     visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.
